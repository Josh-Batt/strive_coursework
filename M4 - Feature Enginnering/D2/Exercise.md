<h1 align="center">Day 2: Data Cleaning (Missings and Outliers)</h1>

## Exercises



### ‚ùì Missing values


1. What is the missing datatype used in pandas?
np.NaN

2. How to replace all occurences of the value 9999 to missing in pandas?
df.replace('9999', np.NaN)

3. How to get the absolute number of missings for each variable in pandas?
df.isnull().sum()

4. How to get the percentage of missings for each variable in pandas?
df.isnull().sum() * 100 / len(df)


5. How to drop rows with missing values?
df.dropna()

6. How to drop variables with missing values?
df.dropna(axis = 1)

7. What is the univariate imputation method in sklearn?
SimpleImputer(missing_values=np.nan, strategy='mean')


8. What is the multivariate imputation method in sklearn?
IterativeImputer(random_state=0)
SimpleImputer().fit_transform(df)

9. What is the best univariate imputation method to categorical variables? (Explain why)
df.SimpleImputer(strategy='Most frequent')
df.SimpleImputer(strategy={'Constant' : 'Missing_value'})

One Hot Encoding, categorical variables can have many diffrent names so one hot Encoding ensures they have diffrent columns. But it adds probably a lot of columns and then it makes more sense to use binary encoding.

10. What is the best univariate imputation method to numerical variables? (Explain why)
Normalization, makes the data a normal distrobution graph. Shows you where most of the data is consitrated instead of sqewed data
Develop an Intuition and then do --> Univariate or multivariate Imputation OR use XGBoost and LightBGM

### üîé Outliers

1. What is an outlier?
An outlier is an observation that lies an abnormal distance from other values in a random sample from a population.

2. What is a simple method to detect and deal with outliers of a numerical variable?
Univariate method
One of the simplest methods for detecting outliers is the use of box plots. 
A box plot is a graphical display for describing the distribution of the data. 
Box plots use the median and the lower and upper quartiles.

3. What is novelty detection?
Novelty detection is the identification of new or unknown data or signals that a machine learning system is not aware of during training. 
Novelty detection methods try to identify outliers that differ from the distribution of ordinary data.

4. Name 4 advanced methods of outlier detection in sklearn.
A) Isolation Forest, or iForest for short, is a tree-based anomaly detection algorithm.
It is based on modeling the normal data in such a way as to isolate anomalies that are both few in number and different in the feature space.

B) The Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD) method is a highly robust estimator of multivariate location and scatter, for which a fast algorithm is available.
It also serves as a convenient and efficient tool for outlier detection

C) Local Outlier Factor-A simple approach to identifying outliers is to locate those examples that are far from the other examples in the feature space.

D) One-Class SVM - is a classification algorithm, it can be used to discover outliers in input data for both regression and classification datasets.

### üñã Typos

1. What is a typo?
A typo is a mistake in written or published writing. Checking of spelling is a basic requirement in any text processing or analysis. 
The python package pyspellchecker provides us this feature to find the words that may have been mis-spelled and also suggest the possible corrections.

2. What is a good method of automatically detect typos?
pyspellchecker - uses Levenshtein Distance algorithm to find permutations within an edit distance of 2 from the original word. 
It then compares all permutations (insertions, deletions, replacements, and transpositions) to known words in a word frequency list. 
Those words that are found more often in the frequency list are more likely the correct results.


### Practical case

Consider the following dataset: [San Francisco Building Permits](https://www.kaggle.com/aparnashastry/building-permit-applications-data). 
Look at the columns "Street Number Suffix" and "Zipcode". Both of these contain missing values.

- Which, if either, are missing because they don't exist?
- Which, if either, are missing because they weren't recorded?

Hint: Do all addresses generally have a street number suffix? Do all addresses generally have a zipcode?

## Understand this code to perform the group imputation:

```python
df = pd.read_csv("titanic/train.csv", index_col='PassengerId')

group_cols = ['Sex','Pclass','Title']
impute_map = df.groupby(group_cols).Age.mean().reset_index(drop=False)

for index, row in impute_map.iterrows(): # Iterate all group possibilities
    
    ind = (df[group_cols] == row[group_cols]).all(axis=1) # Returns Boolean column with the lenth of dataframe        
    
    df[ind] = df[ind].fillna(row["Age"])
```
